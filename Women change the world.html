<h3><p><u><b><font color="blue">Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain and her dreams about ‘Ladyland’</FONT></b></u><h3><br>
<h2>Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880 –1932) was born into a rich family who owned a lot of land. Though
she knew how to read and write Urdu, she was stopped from learning Bangla and English. In those
days, English was seen as a language that would expose girls to new ideas, which people thought were
not correct for them.Therefore, it was mostly boys who were taught English. Rokeya learnt
to read and write Bangla and English with the support of her elder brother and an elder
sister. She went on to become a writer. She wrote a remarkable story titled
Sultana’s Dream in 1905 to practise her English skills when she was merely 25
years old. This story imagined a woman called Sultana who reaches a place
called Ladyland. Ladyland is a place where women had the freedom to study,
work, and create inventions like controlling rain from the clouds and
flying air cars. In this Ladyland, the men had been sent into seclusion –

their aggressive guns and other weapons of war defeated by the brain-
power of women. As Sultana travels in Ladyland with Sister Sarah,

she awakes to realise that she was only dreaming.
As you can see, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain was dreaming of
women flying planes and cars even before girls were being
allowed to go to school! This was the way in which education
and learning had changed Rokeya’s own life. Rokeya did not
stop at getting education just for herself. Her education gave
her the power not only to dream and write, but also to do
more – to help other girls go to school and to build their
own dreams. In 1910, she started a school for girls in Kolkata,
and to this day, the school is still functioning.</p><h2>

<P><h3>Malala Yousafzai initially became famous for her childhood activism against the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan's (TTP's) restrictions on education for girls. She appeared on television and wrote a blog for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Her fame soared after a gunman shot her in the head in 2012, when she was 15 years old, and she survived.</p></h3>
